# World Health Report — Tick 637,485

**Date:** 2026-03-01
**Sim Time:** Spring Day 82, Year 2
**Context:** Round 24 deployed ~2,800 ticks ago. First weekly tick with new occupation functions fires in ~7 real minutes. This is a **pre-effect baseline** — Round 24 has not yet acted on the world.

## World State Summary

The world is healthy and growing steadily. Population 287K (+686/day), satisfaction 0.690, near-zero deaths (8 total), trade volume 5.77M and accelerating. The economy is stable with 96.6% market health and Gini compressing slightly (0.589→0.588). The occupation monoculture problem persists unchanged: **70-80% Crafters** across all sampled settlements, with producers (Farmer, Fisher, Miner, Hunter, Laborer, Alchemist combined) at only **3-6% per settlement**. Round 24 functions have not fired yet — the first weekly tick is imminent.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Trend | Assessment |
|--------|-------|-------|------------|
| Population | 287,178 | +686/day | Healthy growth |
| Death:Birth Ratio | 0.00004 | Stable | Near-zero |

| Avg Effective Mood | 0.584 | Stable | Good |
| Avg Alignment | 0.356 | Stable | Normal |
| Gini | 0.589 | -0.002 | Slowly compressing |
| Richest 10% share | 50.3% | — | Moderate inequality |
| Poorest 50% share | 14.0% | — | Typical for medieval |
| Trade Volume | 5.77M | +754K (9 days) | Accelerating |
| Total Wealth | 1.32B | Stable | Conserved |
| Market Health | 96.6% | — | Excellent |
| Active Settlements | 480 | Stable | 234 ghosts remaining |
| Faction Members | 262,562 (91%) | — | Healthy participation |

## Occupation Distribution (PRE-ROUND 24 BASELINE)

Sampled across 7 active settlements:

| Settlement | Pop | Crafter% | Producer% | Notes |
|-----------|-----|---------|----------|-------|
| Oldwick | 1,078 | 56% | 9% | Largest producer share |
| Longhollow | 1,021 | 70% | 5% | Typical |
| Stormwick | 1,155 | 74% | 6% | High alchemist count (59) |
| Newgate | 470 | 74% | 5% | Typical |
| Stonevale | 90 | 80% | 3% | Small settlement |
| Blackmarsh | 144 | 80% | 5% | Small settlement |
| Stonewick | 529 | 71% | 5% | Typical |

**Average: ~72% Crafter, ~5% Producer.** This is the problem Round 24 targets.

## Tier 2 Agents

55 alive Tier 2 agents (up from 47 at last report). Occupation breakdown:
- **38 Crafters** (69%) — still dominant
- 5 Alchemists, 5 Farmers, 2 Scholars, 2 Soldiers, 1 Merchant, 1 Laborer, 1 Fisher
- 0 Miners, 0 Hunters — still unrepresented
- All showing positive wellbeing (Zara Briar: sat 0.692, mood 0.882, coherence 1.0)

Tier 2 diversity cap (Round 23, 40% max per occupation) hasn't had enough time to correct the 69% crafter share yet.

## Faction Health

| Faction | Members | Treasury | Kind |
|---------|---------|----------|------|
| Verdant Circle | 113,200 | 10.3M | Religious |
| The Crown | 73,042 | 17.1M | Political |
| Ashen Path | 39,692 | 5.0M | Criminal |
| Iron Brotherhood | 19,186 | 2.8M | Military |
| Merchant's Compact | 17,442 | 7.0M | Economic |

Verdant Circle dominates with 43% of affiliated agents. Crown has largest treasury (17M). All 5 factions healthy and collecting dues.

## Governance

| Type | Count | % |
|------|-------|---|
| Council | 451 | 94% |
| Commune | 20 | 4% |
| Merchant Republic | 5 | 1% |
| Monarchy | 4 | 1% |

Still heavily Council-dominated. Round 23 governance inheritance + lower revolution barriers need more time. 0 tiny settlements (<25 pop) — consolidation working.

## Economic Health

- **Market health 96.6%** — excellent
- **Most inflated:** Grain at 2.5x base in 5 settlements (Stonewood, Goldford, Brightreach, Greentown, Stonecliff) — price-sensitive demand should correct
- **Most deflated:** Grain at Agnosis floor (0.236x) in 4 settlements, Furs at floor in Stonereach — oversupply
- **Treasury wealth:** 889M (40.5% of total) — within target range
- **Agent wealth:** 1.31B (59.5%) — healthy distribution

## Health Assessment

### Working Well
- **Economy:** 96.6% market health, trade accelerating, Gini slowly compressing
- **Population:** Steady +686/day growth, near-zero deaths
- **Satisfaction:** 0.690 — highest ever, slightly softening but well above danger zone
- **Factions:** All 5 active with healthy treasuries and membership
- **Infrastructure:** Zero tiny settlements, consolidation complete

### Concerning
- **Occupation monoculture:** 70-80% Crafters, 3-6% Producers — **Round 24 targets this, first effects imminent**
- **Satisfaction softening:** -0.013 over 9 days — minor, but worth watching post-Round-24
- **Governance homogeneity:** 94% Councils — revolution mechanics haven't fired yet
- **Tier 2 crafter share:** 69% (38/55) — diversity cap working slowly
- **No Hunters or Miners at Tier 2** — occupation diversity still incomplete

### Round 24 Status
- **Deployed:** ~2,800 ticks ago
- **Phase 1 (disabled forced reassignment):** Active — no more forced crafter conversions
- **Phases 3-5 (migration, recovery, transitions):** First weekly tick imminent (~7 min)
- **Phases 6-7 (Tier 2 relocate/retrain, oracle guide_migration):** Will fire on next daily/weekly decision cycles
- **Rollback playbook:** `docs/24-round-24-rollback-playbook.md` — per-phase disable instructions ready

## Things to Monitor

1. **CRITICAL — Round 24 effects (next 1-7 days):** After first weekly tick, check for "migrated to X seeking farmland" and "begins retraining as a Farmer" events. Run `/observe` again in ~1 hour real time (~10K ticks) to see first effects.
2. **Occupation distribution shift:** Crafters should start declining from 72%. If they don't after 2 weekly ticks, check `LastWorkTick` values — may need grace period adjustment.
3. **Satisfaction stability:** Pre-deploy baseline is 0.690. If it drops below 0.54 (Agnosis below baseline), consider disabling Phase 4 (crafter recovery) per rollback playbook.
4. **Resource migration events:** Should appear within 1 week. If zero appear, producers may not be idle long enough to trigger (2-week grace period). Could shorten if needed.
5. **Governance diversity:** Watch for first revolution events. 94% Councils is structurally monotonous.
