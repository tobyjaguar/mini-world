## Health Assessment

### Working Well
- Economy robust — 94.6% market health, trade growing 8.3%/period, treasury targeting at ~40%
- Population healthy — D:B 0.055, no survival crisis
- Settlement consolidation complete — zero tiny settlements
- Gini slowly declining — progressive decay + welfare working
- Alignment rising — coherence development progressing across population

### Concerns

**P1: Tier 2 Merchants Non-Functional**
All 6 Tier 2 merchants show `alignment: 0.000` and `wealth: 0`. They appear unable to trade or earn income. Likely a code path issue — the Tier 2 "work" action may not route merchants through merchant trade logic.

**P2: Tier 2 Farmer Satisfaction (-0.099)**
Same producer misery gap from round 12. Farmers still failing production on depleted hexes more than succeeding. Hex health model should help long-term.

**P3: Grain Price Ceilings**
5 settlements (Stoneport, Darkwell, Millhaven, Newhaven, Ashhelm) at Totality ceiling (5.0 crowns). Possible food deserts.

**P3: No Tier 2 Fishers/Hunters/Miners**
Round 14 occupation-aware promotion deployed but these slots remain unfilled.

## Action Items
- [ ] Investigate and fix Tier 2 merchant bug (P1)
- [ ] Monitor hex health distribution for farmer recovery
- [ ] Check grain ceiling settlements for trade route coverage
- [ ] Watch Tier 2 replenishment for fisher/hunter/miner promotion
- [ ] Track satisfaction trajectory — did 0.302 hold or was it noise?
