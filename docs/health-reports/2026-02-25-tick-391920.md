## Fixes Deployed This Session

**Tuning Round 16: Tier 2 Merchant Death Spiral (fixes 82-83)**

1. **Fix 82 — Replenishment diversity pass**: Moved before vacancy early-return with independent budget (max 2/week). Unrepresented occupations get promoted even when alive count meets target.
2. **Fix 83 — Merchant trade needs boosts**: `sellMerchantCargo()` now gives Safety +0.008, Esteem +0.012, Belonging +0.004, Purpose +0.004 on successful cargo sale. Matches producer work boosts.

**Status:** Deployed, awaiting first weekly tick to verify.

## What to Monitor Next Session

- [ ] Verify Tier 2 merchants promoted (diversity pass fired)
- [ ] Check new merchant survival — are needs boosts keeping them alive?
- [ ] Check if fishers/hunters/miners also get promoted via diversity pass
- [ ] Track farmer satisfaction — still the structural weak point (-0.10)
- [ ] Watch grain ceiling settlements (5 at Totality) for food desert effects
- [ ] Satisfaction hovering at 0.298 — confirm it holds above 0.29
- [ ] Gini at 0.600 — confirm continued slow decline
