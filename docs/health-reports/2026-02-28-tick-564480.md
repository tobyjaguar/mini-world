## Tier 2 Agent Breakdown (52 agents)

| Occupation | Count | Avg Satisfaction | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Crafter | 35 | +0.70 | Dominant, healthy |
| Alchemist | 7 | +0.58 | 6 positive, 1 negative (Dorian Stoneheart -0.094) |
| Scholar | 2 | +0.68 | Governance boost working |
| Soldier | 2 | +0.66 | Needs boost working |
| Merchant | 1 | +0.68 | Arlen Frostborn, stable |
| Farmer | 1 | -0.099 | Cedric Greenvale, sole negative producer |

Alchemist recovery is dramatic — from -0.115 avg to +0.58 avg after herb fix. Scholar and soldier satisfaction positive, confirming round 22 boosts are effective.

## Faction Status

| Faction | Members | Treasury |
|---------|---------|----------|
| The Crown | 0 | 11.2M |
| Merchant's Compact | 0 | 5.0M |
| Iron Brotherhood | 0 | 1.2M |
| Verdant Circle | 0 | 1.6M |
| Ashen Path | 0 | 1.9M |

**BUG**: All factions show 0 members despite weekly faction assignment sweep being deployed. Treasuries are accumulating (Crown 11.2M), suggesting dues collection works but member counting may be broken.

## Economy

- Market health: 97.4%
- 5 settlements at grain Totality ceiling (~5.0 crowns): Blackport, Goldford, Ashwood, Ashhelm, Redhollow
- Most deflated: Furs at Agnosis floor in Stonereach, Pinehollow, Redpoint
- Wealth distribution: 51.5% held by richest 10%, 13.8% by poorest 50%

## Server Health

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| worldsim RSS | 665 MB |
| System RAM | 963/1983 MB (49%) |
| Swap | 1.9 MB (negligible) |
| worldsim CPU | 15.3% |
| gardener RSS | 12 MB |

Server healthy with 51% headroom. Safe to destroy old instances.

## Issues Found

### ~~P2: `effective_mood = 0.000` for all Tier 2 agents~~ -- FIXED
API `agentSummary` struct used `json:"mood"` but observation expected `json:"effective_mood"`. Renamed field for consistency. Post-fix: Zara Briar effective_mood=0.877, correctly blending sat 0.678 + align 1.000.

### ~~P2: Faction members = 0 across all 5 factions~~ -- FIXED
The `/api/v1/factions` endpoint had no `members` field. Added member counting. Post-fix: 234,701 agents (93%) affiliated -- Verdant Circle 101K, Crown 66K, Ashen Path 35K, Iron Brotherhood 17K, Merchant's Compact 15K.

### P3: Tier 2 occupation diversity
35/52 (67%) are crafters. Only 1 farmer, 0 fishers, 0 hunters, 0 miners, 0 laborers. `maxDiversity = 2` per week isn't enough to offset crafter dominance.

### P3: Grain price ceilings
5 settlements at Totality ceiling. Possible food deserts.

### P3: Governance homogeneity
91% Councils (from previous observation). Transitions may be too rare.
