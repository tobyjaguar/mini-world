# Health Report — Tick 476,963 (Feb 27, 2026)

**Context**: Round 19 (Tier 2 merchant intelligence) deployed ~300 ticks ago. All 6 Tier 2 merchants are dead from pre-deploy extinction. Monitoring for replenishment cycle to promote new merchants with the intelligence features.

## World State Summary

The world is in excellent health with strong, steady growth. Population has crossed 211K (+3.0% in the last 9 sim-days), death:birth ratio is an extraordinary 0.011 (67 deaths vs 6,153 births in the observation window), and trade volume is accelerating at 2,163 trades/day. Satisfaction holds at 0.301, alignment climbing at 0.424, and Gini remains stable at 0.601. The economy is functioning well with 98.3% market health. The only significant issue is the Tier 2 merchant gap — all 6 dead, awaiting weekly replenishment cycle to test round 19 fixes.

## Tier 2 Agent Health

| Occupation | Alive | Dead | Avg Wealth | Avg Satisfaction | Avg Mood |
|-----------|-------|------|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| Crafter | 14 | 0 | 60,283 | +0.697 | +0.830 |
| Farmer | 25 | 0 | 31,388 | -0.098 | +0.463 |
| Laborer | 2 | 0 | 4,702 | +0.712 | +0.623 |
| Fisher | 1 | 0 | 1,512 | -0.106 | +0.578 |
| Hunter | 1 | 0 | 1,895 | -0.085 | -0.174 |
| **Merchant** | **0** | **6** | **—** | **—** | **—** |

Key observations:
- All Tier 2 farmers have coherence 1.0 (Liberated) — alignment rescues their effective mood despite -0.10 satisfaction
- The single Tier 2 hunter has **negative effective mood** (-0.174) — the only living Tier 2 agent with negative mood
- Crafters dominate wealth (avg 60K) with strong satisfaction (+0.70)
- Farmer satisfaction stuck at -0.10 — the `bestProductionHex()` fix hasn't visibly improved satisfaction yet over ~28K ticks

## Economy

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Agent Wealth | 1.361B |
| Treasury Wealth | 922M |
| Total Crowns | 2.283B |
| Poorest 50% share | 13.5% |
| Richest 10% share | 51.5% |
| Trade/day | ~2,163 (accelerating) |

**Prices**: 5 settlements at Totality ceiling for grain (Darkwell, Greendale, Copperbury, Ashhelm, Stoneford — same as before). 3 settlements at Agnosis floor for grain (Whitetown, Deepwell, Rivercrest). Price spread is within normal bounds.

**Wealth distribution**: Richest 10% hold 51.5% (down from 60% at peak). Poorest 50% hold 13.5%. Gini at 0.601, slowly compressing.

## Faction Health

| Faction | Treasury | Influence Spread |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| The Crown | 10.28M | 77 settlements, up to 47% (Newgate) |
| Merchant's Compact | 4.53M | 78 settlements, up to 96% (Whitetown) |
| Verdant Circle | 0.97M | 262 settlements, 10-21% each |
| Ashen Path | 1.56M | 34 settlements, up to 23% (Oldbrook) |
| Iron Brotherhood | 0.96M | 22 settlements, up to 14% (Riverbury) |

- **Verdant Circle** has the broadest presence (262 settlements) but thin influence (~10-12% each)
- **The Crown** and **Merchant's Compact** dominate their strongholds
- **Iron Brotherhood** remains weakest — only 22 settlements with any presence

## Settlement Health

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Active | 714 (480 with pop > 0) |
| Abandoned (pop = 0) | 234 |
| Avg population | 297 (active) |
| Min/Max pop | 0 / 1,216 |
| Governance | Council 652, Commune 49, Merchant Republic 9, Monarchy 4 |

The 234 "tiny" settlements (pop < 25) includes the 234 abandoned ones (pop = 0). All real settlements have consolidated above viability thresholds.

## Health Assessment

### Working Well
- **Population growth**: D:B ratio 0.011 is extraordinary — near-zero mortality
- **Market health**: 98.3%, up from 95.8% — the economy is functioning better than ever
- **Trade acceleration**: Volume increasing steadily, up ~3,000 in the last snapshot alone
- **Treasury balance**: 40.3% share, almost exactly on the Φ⁻¹ target (38.2%)
- **Gini compression**: Slowly but steadily declining from 0.630 to 0.601
- **Coherence**: 0.608 population-wide, all Tier 2 agents at 1.0 (Liberated)

### Concerning
- **Tier 2 merchants**: All 6 dead, round 19 deployed but no replenishment cycle has run yet — need to wait for weekly tick
- **Farmer satisfaction stuck**: -0.098 average, unchanged since round 17 `bestProductionHex()` deployed ~28K ticks ago. The hex spread fix may need more time, or farmer production economics need further tuning
- **Single hunter Tier 2**: Negative mood (-0.174) — isolated case but worth monitoring
- **Grain price ceilings**: Same 5 settlements stuck at Totality — merchants (once alive) could relieve this

## Things to Monitor

1. **Tier 2 merchant replenishment** — Next weekly tick should promote new merchants. Check if they survive with round 19's wealth gate + net-profit check. Look for scout_route actions in logs.
2. **Farmer satisfaction trajectory** — Still at -0.10. If unchanged after another sim-week, may need another tuning pass (production boosts, needs adjustment, or hex health improvement).
3. **Hunter Tier 2 mood** — Only 1 alive, negative mood. Is this a systemic issue or individual circumstance?
4. **Trade volume acceleration** — Confirm the upward trend continues. Once merchants are alive, this should jump further.
5. **Grain ceiling settlements** — 5 at Totality. Merchant trade routes should relieve this if merchants survive.
6. **Round 19 in action** — After merchant replenishment, check: (a) trade memories via agent detail API, (b) scout_route in logs, (c) wealth accumulation vs previous merchant cohort.
