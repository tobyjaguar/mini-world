**Sim Time:** Winter Day 67, Year 1
**Season:** Summer (API) / Winter (sim_time) — cosmetic mismatch

## World State Summary

The world is in a **satisfaction crisis** triggered by Round 20's mint closure deployment (between T479,520 and T480,960). Average satisfaction crashed from 0.302 to 0.136 — a 55% decline in one snapshot interval. Population growth remains strong (D:B 0.006) and the economy is mechanically functional (98.2% market health), but the satisfaction collapse reveals that four occupations — Laborer, Alchemist, Miner, and Taverner — have **completely vanished** from the population. They don't appear in any settlement's occupation breakdown. 69% of agents are now Farmers (was ~28%), suggesting the missing ~38% of the workforce was silently reassigned or their occupation label stopped being counted.

| Farmer | -0.10 | Depressed (unchanged, 69% of pop drags average) |
| Crafter | +0.70 | Healthy |
| Soldier | +0.70 | Healthy |
| Scholar | +0.70 | Healthy |
| Merchant | +0.69 | Healthy |
| Fisher | +0.57 (Tier 2) | OK |
| Hunter | -0.17 (Tier 2) | Struggling |

## Political & Social State

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Governance avg | 0.635 |
| At-risk settlements | 14 |
| Governance types | Council 451, Commune 20, Merchant Republic 5, Monarchy 4 |
| Families | 6,684 |
| Rivalries | 0 |
| Avg Sentiment | 0.254 |

### Faction Health

| Faction | Kind | Treasury | Settlements |
|---------|------|----------|-------------|
| The Crown | Political | 10.28M | 78 |
| Merchant's Compact | Economic | 4.53M | 80 |
| Verdant Circle | Religious | 0.97M | ~260 |
| Ashen Path | Criminal | 1.56M | 34 |
| Iron Brotherhood | Military | 0.96M | 22 |

**Notable:** The Verdant Circle has broad but thin influence (~10-11% in ~260 settlements). The Crown has deep influence in monarchies (Newgate 47%, Redhollow 38%, Ashhelm 34%). Merchant's Compact has a monopoly in Whitetown (96%).

### Tier 2 Distribution

| Occupation | Alive | Avg Mood | Avg Wealth |
|------------|-------|----------|------------|
| Farmer | 25 | 0.462 | 25,338 |
| Crafter | 14 | 0.831 | 49,525 |
| Laborer | 2 | 0.174 | 3,816 |
| Fisher | 1 | 0.572 | 903 |
| Hunter | 1 | -0.173 | 1,371 |
| **Merchant** | **0 (6 dead)** | — | — |

**Note:** 2 Tier 2 Laborers still exist despite 0 Tier 0 Laborers — they were promoted before the occupation vanished.

## Grain Price Analysis

5 settlements at Totality ceiling (~5.0 crowns): Blackport, Blackcliff, Stonecliff, Stonefield, Ashhelm — unchanged from previous report. 2 settlements at Agnosis floor (~0.47 crowns): Whitetown, Rivercrest. Grain price dispersion is extreme, suggesting merchant trade routes aren't reaching ceiling settlements.

## Health Assessment

### What's Working
1. **Population growth** — D:B ratio 0.006, adding ~690 agents/day consistently
2. **Economy mechanical health** — 98.2% market health, trade volume accelerating (+12.5%)
3. **Gini stable** — 0.600, slowly compressing
4. **Zero deaths** in recent periods (all cumulative deaths at 19,258)
5. **Wealth conservation** — total crowns stable at 1.36B, treasury share at Φ target

### What's Concerning

1. **P0: Satisfaction crash from 0.30 to 0.13** — Triggered by round 20 deployment. The world went from stable-at-target to deeply depressed in one tick interval. The root cause is that **four occupations have vanished entirely** (Laborer, Alchemist, Miner, Taverner), and the remaining population is 69% Farmers at satisfaction -0.10.

2. **P0: Missing occupations** — Laborers (20% of pop), Alchemists (7%), Miners (8%), and Taverners (3%) no longer exist as Tier 0 agents. They either were reassigned to Farmer/Crafter during the round 20 deploy, or newborns stopped spawning with these occupations. This is a **structural break** in the world's occupational diversity.

3. **P1: Farmer satisfaction stuck at -0.10** — With 69% of the population as farmers, this single occupation drives the entire world's satisfaction average. The hex spread fix (round 17) should have helped, but farmers remain at -0.10 across all settlements sampled.

4. **P2: All 6 Tier 2 merchants dead** — Unchanged from previous report. The merchant intelligence fixes (round 19) haven't had time to produce new Tier 2 merchants, or the weekly replenishment isn't promoting any.

5. **P3: Season mismatch** — API reports "Summer" but sim_time says "Winter Day 67". Cosmetic bug.

## Root Cause Analysis: The Satisfaction Crash

The crash happened between T479,520 (sat=0.302) and T480,960 (sat=0.136). This is exactly the window where round 20 deployed.

Round 20 closed open mints for Laborers, Alchemists, Crafters, and Merchants. The expected effect was that these occupations would transition to real production (stone, herbs, etc.). But the actual effect was:

1. **Laborer/Alchemist/Miner/Taverner occupations vanished entirely** — 0 agents in any settlement
2. **Farmer population exploded from ~28% to ~69%** — these agents were likely reassigned
3. **Satisfaction averaged down** because the -0.10 farmers now dominate the weighted average

**Hypothesis:** The round 20 code changes may have altered the occupation assignment logic in `spawner.go` or `population.go`, causing all newborns to be assigned as Farmer or Crafter. Or existing agents' occupations were recalculated on a deploy restart and they lost their Laborer/Miner/Alchemist/Taverner labels.

## Suggested Improvements

### 1. **URGENT: Investigate missing occupations** (P0)
Check `spawner.go` occupation assignment logic and `population.go` birth occupation selection. Verify that Laborer, Alchemist, Miner, and Taverner are still in the occupation pool. This is the single most impactful issue — restoring occupation diversity would immediately improve avg satisfaction from 0.13 to ~0.30+.

### 2. **Fix farmer satisfaction** (P1)
Farmers at -0.10 with 69% of the population is the dominant drag. Even with hex spread (round 17), farmers are stuck. Investigate whether:
- Hex health has recovered enough for successful production
- The production boost per-tick is sufficient for satisfaction recovery
- Production success rate (how often does `bestProductionHex()` find a healthy hex?)

### 3. **Monitor wealth after mint closure** (P2)
Total wealth is stable at 1.36B but should be watched. With open mints closed, the only crown source is welfare. If welfare isn't compensating adequately, wealth could start concentrating.

## Things to Monitor

1. **Occupation distribution** — are newborns spawning with all 11 occupations?
2. **Satisfaction trajectory** — is it stable at 0.13 or still declining?
3. **Laborer/Alchemist production** — if occupations are restored, are they producing stone/herbs?
4. **Tier 2 merchant replenishment** — are new merchants being promoted?
5. **Total wealth trend** — watch for wealth destruction now that mints are closed
6. **Hex health distribution** — are hexes recovering under the spread production model?
7. **Trade volume per capita** — currently accelerating, good sign
