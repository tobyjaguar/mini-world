## Tier 2 Agent Breakdown

| Occupation | Count | Avg Sat | Notes |
|------------|-------|---------|-------|
| Farmer | 20 | -0.098 | Still negative, structural issue |
| Crafter | 14 | +0.700 | Thriving |
| Merchant | 6 | +0.384 | All alive! Fix 82-83 working |
| Laborer | 2 | +0.685 | Healthy |
| Hunter | 1 | -0.116 | New via diversity pass |
| Fisher | 1 | -0.130 | New via diversity pass |
| Miner | 0 | — | Not yet promoted |
| Soldier | 0 | — | Not yet promoted |
| Scholar | 0 | — | Not yet promoted |

**Coherence notes:** All farmers have coherence 1.0 (Liberated) — they endure poor material conditions through alignment. Most merchants at 0.5-0.6 (Awakening). All crafters at 1.0.

## Economy Detail

| Metric | Value | Previous |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Agent Wealth | 1.331B | 1.298B |
| Treasury Wealth | 915M | 881M |
| Total Crowns | 2.246B | 2.179B |
| Poorest 50% Share | 13.2% | 13.2% |
| Richest 10% Share | 51.1% | 50.0% |

**Most inflated:** 5 settlements at Totality grain ceiling (5.00 crowns): Blackcliff, Ironhelm, Stonecliff, Pinegate, Whitehollow (changed from previous 5 — problem is persistent but migrating)
**Most deflated:** 2 settlements at Agnosis grain floor (0.47 crowns): Whitetown, Rivercrest (unchanged)

## Faction State

| Faction | Treasury | Influence Spread |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| The Crown | 9.90M | 79 settlements, strongest in Newgate (47.7%), Redhollow (40.0%) |
| Merchant's Compact | 4.37M | 79 settlements, dominant in Whitetown (96.3%), Highbury (26.5%) |
| Verdant Circle | 0.91M | 268 settlements, even spread (10-13% typical), broad base |
| Ashen Path | 1.49M | 33 settlements, max in Oakwell (20%), Oldbrook (20%) |
| Iron Brotherhood | 0.91M | 22 settlements, max in Riverbury (14.8%), Stonehollow (11.9%) |

**Notes:** Verdant Circle remains the most geographically widespread but low-intensity. Crown and Merchant's Compact have the most concentrated influence. Iron Brotherhood and Ashen Path remain small.

## Settlement Structure

- 173 settlements at 500+ population (was 137 at tick 370K)
- 0 tiny settlements (<25)
- Population range: 25-1,159
- Median population: 330
- Governance: 451 Council, 20 Commune, 5 Merchant Republic, 4 Monarchy

## Monitoring Checklist (from last report)

- [x] Verify Tier 2 merchants promoted — **YES, 6 alive** (Arlen Deepwell, Oswin Millward, Eira Wolfsbane, Thea Embercroft, Calla Steelworth, Birgit Steelworth)
- [x] Check new merchant survival — **YES, sat 0.19-0.59**, all stable
- [x] Check fishers/hunters/miners in Tier 2 — **Fisher: 1 (Yara Dunmore), Hunter: 1 (Magnus Silverdale), Miner: 0** (partial)
- [ ] Farmer satisfaction still at -0.10 — **Unchanged**, structural producer misery persists
- [ ] Grain ceiling settlements — **5 still at ceiling**, different settlements than before (rotating)
- [x] Satisfaction holds above 0.29 — **YES, at 0.298-0.300**
- [x] Gini declining — **YES, compressed from 0.630 to 0.601 in recent window**

## Health Assessment

### Working Well
1. **Population growth**: +14.8% in ~57K ticks, excellent D:B ratio (0.174 cumul)
2. **Tier 2 diversity**: Round 16 fix delivered — merchants alive, fisher and hunter promoted
3. **Gini compression**: 0.630 → 0.601 in recent window, wealth redistributing
4. **Trade volume**: +33.2% growth, strong economic activity
5. **Alignment climbing**: 0.386 → 0.418 (+8.3%), world becoming more aligned
6. **Coherence high**: Avg 0.605 population-wide, most Tier 2 at 1.0

### Concerning
1. **Farmer satisfaction stuck at -0.10**: 20 Tier 2 farmers all negative. Structural issue — depleted hexes, production failures. Hex health should help long-term but hasn't shown effect yet.
2. **Total crowns slowly inflating**: 2.179B → 2.246B (+3.1%). Journeyman/laborer wage mint still active. Monitor.
3. **Market health dipped**: 97.9% → 95.8%. Still healthy but watch for continued decline.
4. **Richest 10% share crept up**: 50.0% → 51.1%. Gini is compressing overall but top concentration slightly grew.
5. **No Tier 2 miners/soldiers/scholars yet**: Diversity pass has room to promote more occupations.

## What to Monitor Next Session

- [ ] Farmer satisfaction trajectory — is hex health helping at all? Compare to -0.10
- [ ] Total crown inflation — is the ~3% growth per reporting period sustainable?
- [ ] Tier 2 miner promotion — should appear via diversity pass
- [ ] Market health — did the 2.1% dip continue or stabilize?
- [ ] When does population hit 200K? (should be within ~1-2K ticks at current rate)
- [ ] Grain ceiling rotation — are the same settlements stuck or does it move around?
- [ ] Merchant satisfaction spread — why is Arlen Deepwell at 0.19 while Birgit Steelworth at 0.59?
