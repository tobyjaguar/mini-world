# Health Report — Tick 512,655 (2026-02-27)

## Context

First observation after deploying memory optimizations: population ceiling (500K), dead agent compaction, GOGC=50, GC-friendly event trim, rebuildSettlementAgents skip-dead fix.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Prev (483,840) | Delta |
|--------|-------|----------------|-------|
| Population | 228,830 | 215,132 | +6.4% |
| Satisfaction | 0.133 | 0.132 | Flat |
| Alignment | 0.404 | 0.420 | -3.8% |
| Effective Mood | 0.185 | 0.192 | -3.6% |
| Gini | 0.605 | 0.600 | +0.8% |
| Trade Volume | 297,095 | 161,146 | +84% |
| Total Wealth | 1.359B | 1.360B | -0.1% |
| Treasury Share | 40.5% | ~40.5% | Stable |
| Market Health | 97.3% | 98.2% | -0.9% |
| RSS | 551 MB | 712 MB | -23% |
| Swap | 88 MB | 12 MB | +76 MB (GC spikes) |
| Active Settlements | 480 | 480 | Stable |
| Tier 2 Alive | 47 | 43 | +4 |
| Tier 2 Dead | 0 | 6 | Fixed |

## Memory Optimization Results

- **Compaction**: First run at tick 493,920 — removed 19,258 dead agents, pruned 2,232 stale relationships
- **RSS**: 551 MB (down from 712 MB — 23% reduction)
- **GOGC=50**: Active, trading ~10% CPU for lower peak RSS
- **Event trim**: Weekly event counts dropped from 65K → 1.3K (daily trim preventing buildup)
- **Server**: 233 MB available, swap at 88 MB. Comfortable on 1 GB for now.

## Tier 2 Agent Breakdown

| Occupation | Count | Avg Satisfaction | Avg Wealth |
|------------|-------|-----------------|------------|
| Crafter | 14 | +0.700 | 23,806 |
| Soldier | 1 | +0.683 | 8,660 |
| Scholar | 1 | +0.677 | 4,814 |
| Farmer | 24 | -0.099 | 11,342 |
| Fisher | 1 | -0.098 | 7,963 |
| Alchemist | 6 | -0.100 | 2,203 |

No dead Tier 2. But resource producers stuck at -0.10 satisfaction. No merchants, hunters, miners, or laborers at Tier 2.

## Faction Health

| Faction | Treasury | Settlements |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| The Crown | 10.6M | 79 |
| Merchant's Compact | 4.7M | 80 |
| Ashen Path | 1.6M | 37 |
| Verdant Circle | 1.0M | ~250 (shallow ~10.5%) |
| Iron Brotherhood | 1.0M | 21 |

## Population Trends (10-snapshot window)

- Births per period: ~685 (stable, consistent)
- Growth: +2.8% over 12,960 ticks
- Deaths counter: 0 (reset on deploy — persistence bug)
- D:B ratio: uncomputable from API (deaths counter = 0)

## Market Issues

- 5 settlements at grain price ceiling (Totality ~5.0): Greendale, Frostrest, Ironbury, Stormrest, Ashhelm
- 2 settlements with deflated grain (Agnosis floor ~0.47): Whitetown, Rivercrest
- Poorest 50% hold 13.4% of wealth, richest 10% hold 51.5%

## Key Findings

1. **Memory optimizations working as designed.** RSS down 23%, compaction removing dead agents cleanly, server stable.
2. **Satisfaction frozen at 0.133 for 25K+ ticks.** No recovery since round 20 occupation reset. This is the dominant issue.
3. **Resource producer misery gap persists.** Farmers/Fishers/Alchemists at -0.10 sat vs Crafters at +0.70. Round 20 turned ~70% of pop into farmers but satisfaction didn't follow.
4. **Tier 2 occupation diversity still incomplete.** No merchants, hunters, miners, or laborers. Diversity pass may be selecting from empty pools.
5. **Trade volume accelerating strongly** (+84% since last report, +33% within this window).
6. **Closed economy intact.** Wealth conserved (-0.1%), treasury share on target (40.5%).
