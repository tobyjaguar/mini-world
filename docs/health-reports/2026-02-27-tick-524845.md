# Health Report — Tick 524,845 (2026-02-27)

## Context

First observation after server migration: combined worldsim + relay + gardener + nginx on single gp1.sonic (2 GB) instance. Two old 1 GB instances decommissioned. Round 22 occupation rebalancing deployed (laborer→stone, alchemist→herbs, soldier→deterrence, scholar→governance).

## Key Metrics

## Server Migration Results

| Metric | Old (2× 1GB) | New (1× 2GB) | Status |
|--------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| RAM Used | 883 MB (91%) | 905 MB (46%) | Healthy |
| Swap | 12 MB | 0 MB | None needed |
| RSS (worldsim) | 551 MB | 644 MB | Expected (pop growth) |
| Disk | 2.8 GB boot + 20 GB vol | 12 GB boot (20% used) | Simplified |
| Services | worldsim+gardener / relay | worldsim+gardener+relay+nginx | All co-located |
| Load Avg | N/A | 0.07 | Idle |

Migration was seamless. Zero downtime except snapshot→copy window. nginx routing by hostname working correctly: `api.crossworlds.xyz` → :8080, `stream.crossworlds.xyz` → :8081.

## Economy

- **Market health**: 97.9% — excellent
- **Trade volume**: 396,841 (+33.6% from prev) — healthy growth
- **Gini**: 0.596 — improving trend (was 0.621 two reports ago)
- **Wealth distribution**: Poorest 50% hold 13.7%, richest 10% hold 50.9%
- **Treasury targeting**: 41% of total wealth — on Phi target
- **Grain inflation**: Several settlements at price ceiling (2.5x base) — Copperbury, Highwell, Stonefield, Stonecliff, Stoneford
- **Furs deflation**: Multiple settlements at Agnosis floor — oversupply

### Faction Treasuries

| Faction | Treasury | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| The Crown | 10.85M | Dominant — 10x others |
| Merchant's Compact | 4.76M | Second |
| Ashen Path | 1.67M | Criminal |
| Verdant Circle | 1.04M | Religious — ubiquitous presence |
| Iron Brotherhood | 1.03M | Military — weakest |

## Agent Well-Being

### Tier 2 by Occupation

| Occupation | Count | Avg Satisfaction | Avg Wealth | Status |
|------------|-------|-----------------|------------|--------|
| Crafter | 35 | +0.696 | 11,395 | Thriving |
| Scholar | 2 | +0.711 | 16,218 | Thriving |
| Soldier | 1 | +0.673 | 3,819 | OK |
| Merchant | 1 | +0.697 | 1,550 | OK (only 1!) |
| Farmer | 1 | -0.112 | 26,796 | Suffering |
| Alchemist | 6 | -0.102 | 3,624 | Suffering |
| Fisher | 4 | -0.111 | 2,842 | Suffering |
| Hunter | 0 | N/A | N/A | Missing |
| Miner | 0 | N/A | N/A | Missing |
| Laborer | 0 | N/A | N/A | Missing |

**70% of Tier 2 are crafters.** Diversity pass not working well enough.

### Worst Tier 2 Agents

| Agent | Occupation | Satisfaction | Alignment | Wealth |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Yara Dunmore | Fisher | -0.127 | 1.000 | 1,412 |
| Mira Caldwell | Fisher | -0.119 | 1.000 | 983 |
| Stellan Ward | Alchemist | -0.102 | 0.095 | 983 |
| Rowan Windholm | Farmer | -0.102 | 0.182 | 26,794 |
| Per Embercroft | Alchemist | -0.097 | 1.000 | 3,633 |

Note: Liberated fishers/alchemists (alignment 1.0) have deeply negative satisfaction but their EffectiveMood is buffered by alignment — they're "spiritually at peace despite material suffering."

## Settlement Distribution

| Size | Count | % |
|------|-------|---|
| Large (500+) | 200 | 28% |
| Medium (100-500) | 191 | 27% |
| Small (25-100) | 89 | 12% |
| Tiny (<25) | 234 | 33% |
| **Total** | **714** | |

- **234 settlements with pop=0** — ghost towns, structural dead weight
- **Governance**: 652 Council (91%), 49 Commune, 9 Merchant Republic, 4 Monarchy
- **Largest**: Darkfall (1,315), Blackwick (1,281), Crosswell (1,274)

## Gardener Status

Cycling every 6 minutes, correctly triaging as HEALTHY. Recent decisions:
- Injected narrative event about "rediscovery of abandoned lands" (noting 471 ghost settlements)
- Two "no intervention" cycles with good reasoning
- Accurately observes: "satisfaction at 0.136 is low but stable, not deteriorating"

## Issues Identified

### P1 — Satisfaction frozen at 0.136

Satisfaction has been flat at 0.131-0.137 across 20 snapshots (~28K ticks / ~19 sim-days). The producer/crafter gap is enormous. Resource producers (~60% of population) have negative satisfaction while crafters (+0.70) pull the average up. This is structurally the same doom loop as tuning round 12, but now affecting round 20 occupations (alchemists, laborers).

**Investigation needed**: Are the new round 20 occupations (stone production, herb harvesting, soldier deterrence, scholar governance) actually generating needs boosts? Is the alchemist dual-mode (harvest→craft) working?

### P2 — 234 ghost settlements

Settlements with pop=0 are not being cleaned up. The viability system tracks pop<25 for 2 weeks, but pop=0 should be cleared faster. These bloat the settlements API response and confuse the gardener.

### P2 — Tier 2 diversity failure

35/50 alive Tier 2 are crafters (70%). Only 1 farmer, 1 merchant, 1 soldier, 0 hunters/miners/laborers. The diversity pass (maxDiversity=2/week) isn't enough to overcome crafter dominance.

### P3 — Governance homogeneity

91% of settlements are Councils. Governance transitions may be too rare or too biased.

### P3 — Weather API disconnected

`temp_modifier: 0` and empty weather description — the weather API key may not have been set in the new deploy's override conf.

### P3 — Deaths counter reset

Cumulative deaths shows 1 — likely lost during migration data copy. Not mechanically impactful but breaks historical continuity.

## Recommendations

1. **Investigate and fix producer satisfaction** — diagnose whether round 20 occupations are producing and getting needs boosts
2. **Clean up ghost settlements** — add immediate abandonment for pop=0 settlements, or filter them from API responses
3. **Increase Tier 2 diversity budget** — raise maxDiversity from 2→4, or add occupation caps (max 40% single occupation)
4. **Check weather API key** — verify WEATHER_API_KEY is in the systemd override
5. **Monitor Gini trend** — currently improving (0.621→0.596), good sign

## Things to Monitor Next Session

- Satisfaction trend — does it budge from 0.136?
- Alchemist production — are herbs being harvested?
- Hex health — are new occupation production hexes being used?
- Trade volume growth — currently +33%/report, sustained?
- Ghost settlement count — should decrease if viability system working
